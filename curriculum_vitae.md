## Profile
Systems Engineer passionate about designing large applications in the domains of Machine Learning and Deep Learning, with a proven ability to work in teams and act as technical lead.

## Education
**Carnegie Mellon University** - Silicon Valley, California <br />
*MS in Electrical and Computer Engineering : 2017 - 2018* <br />
*GPA : 3.7* <br />
 <br />
 **Vishwakarma Institute of Technology** - Pune, India <br />
 *BTech Instrumentation and Control Engineering : 2011 - 2015* <br />
 *GPA : 3.75*
  <br />
  
## Skills
Python (PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras, Pandas), C/C++ (FreeRTOS, Micropython), Java, R, MatLab, MongoDB

## Work Experience
**Graduate Researcher** - Moffett Field, CA <br />
*Carnegie Mellon University : Jan 2018 - May 2018* <br />
* Research Focus : Model Compression of Deep Network Architectures
* Study of compression techniques used on deep learning models for compute gains during inferencing and training
* Implementation of stochastic quantization and Huffman encoding of weights to reduce model size by a factor of x5 while sacrificing 3% accuracy (98% - 95%)

<br />

**Graduate Research Assistant** - Moffett Field, CA <br />
*Carnegie Mellon University - Computations and Communications Group : Jan 2018 - May 2018* <br />
* Worked as part of a team of 3 to design and develop a unified sensing framework for environmental sensors deployed by the US Geological Survey
* Developed a modular dataflow based sensing library in Micropython for real time embedded applications. The Micropython library was then incorporated into FreeRTOS as a callable function which was sensor agnostic.
* Framework was developed and tested on I2C and SDI-12 sensors real time for concurrent sampling up to a frequency of 1 KHz
